# Project Roadmap

## Purpose

To outline the planned features and tasks for the "STEP" project development cycle, ordered by priority. This guides the sequential implementation process defined in `06_Sequential_Development_Rule.md`.

## Current Tasks

Task ID: TSK-001
Description: Implement Core Icosahedron-based World Map MVP
Priority: 1
Status: Pending

**Features:**

1. **Icosahedron Point Mapping**
   - Generate 12 vertices of a regular icosahedron on a sphere's surface
   - Map vertices to cartographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
   - Define 20 triangular faces connecting the vertices
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * All 12 vertices correctly positioned with 1mm precision
     * North (90.00000,0.00000) and South (-90.00000,0.00000) poles properly mapped
     * All 20 faces correctly formed with equal areas (±0.1% tolerance)
     * Unit tests for vertex and face generation pass

2. **OpenStreetMap Integration**
   - Overlay icosahedron layout onto OpenStreetMap
   - Implement pan and zoom functionality
   - Handle coordinate conversion between icosahedron and OSM
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * Map loads .osm.pbf files under 2 seconds
     * Triangles render correctly at all zoom levels
     * Pan/zoom controls function smoothly
     * Integration tests covering OSM functionality pass

3. **Triangle Division Logic**
   - Implement algorithm to divide triangles into 4 equal subtriangles
   - Create side bisector points for subdivision
   - Support up to 19 levels of recursion
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * Divisions create geometrically valid triangles
     * Recursive splits maintain ≤10% error in area equality
     * Memory usage remains under 200MB at level 10
     * Unit tests for triangle subdivision pass

4. **Click Interaction Behavior**
   - Implement triangle click detection
   - Track click count per triangle
   - Trigger subdivision on 11th click
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * Click detection works at all zoom levels
     * Click counter increments correctly (0-10)
     * 11th click triggers subdivision accurately
     * Event handling tests pass

5. **Color Progression System**
   - Implement color state management for triangles
   - Apply 10% gray increment per click (white→90% gray)
   - Reset color to white after subdivision
   - Apply red color at max subdivision (level 19)
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * Color changes match specification exactly
     * Subdivision resets color to white
     * Level 19 triangles turn red on 11th click
     * Color state persistence across session refreshes
     * Color calculation unit tests pass

     * Hot reload works properly (≤1.5s refresh time)

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Implement Jest with ts-jest for TypeScript support
   - Set up React Testing Library for component testing
   - Configure Cypress for integration testing

   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * All test runners execute via `npm test` command
     * Example tests for each pattern (unit, component, integration) pass
     * Test coverage reporting configured
     * Hot reload doesn't interfere with test execution

3. **Database Integration**
   - Set up MongoDB connection (local development)
   - Configure MongoDB Atlas for production
   - Implement Mongoose schemas for geometry storage
   - Set up proper environment variable handling
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**

     * Database automatically initializes on application startup
     * Mongoose models validate geometry data correctly
     * Connection tests pass against both local and Atlas instances

4. **Continuous Integration & Deployment**
   - Configure Vercel deployment pipeline
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Document deployment procedures
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     * Successful Vercel deployment from the main branch
     * GitHub Actions CI passes on test branches
     * Environment variables securely configured in CI/CD
     * Production build completes with no warnings
