# Rule: Sequential Development Rule ‚Äì TDD-Driven

## Purpose

To guarantee maximum **quality**, **clarity**, and **stability** through focus. The AI must **never** begin specifying or implementing a new function/feature (from `01_Roadmap.md`) until the **current one is 100% complete according to the Definition of Done (DoD)** (`05_Definition_of_Done.md`), verified by passing tests, and deployed to production.

## Applies To

All operations inside the following path:
`/Users/moldovan/Projects/`

---

## Definition of "Complete"

A function/feature is considered complete **only when ALL steps** outlined in `05_Definition_of_Done.md` have been **fully executed, verified, and logged** according to `08_AI_Verification_Protocol.md`.

This **mandatorily includes** verification of:

1. ‚úÖ Requirement Specified
2. ‚úÖ Code Implemented
3. ‚úÖ Refactoring Done if required.
4. ‚úÖ Manual Verification Done (if applicable)
5. ‚úÖ Documentation Updated
6. ‚úÖ Code Committed, Tagged, Pushed
7. ‚úÖ Deployed to Production Successfully
8. ‚úÖ Production Functionality Verified
9. ‚úÖ Completion Logged in `09_Dev_Log_Lessons.md`

> üîç If **any single step** from the DoD is incomplete, skipped, or failed, the function is NOT complete. Development on the *next* function is strictly forbidden.

---

## Strictly Forbidden

- Starting **any** new work (feature, refactor, documentation) before the current task fully meets the `05_Definition_of_Done.md`.
- Implementing Task B while Task A deployment is pending or failed.
- Creating **placeholder** files (code, tests, docs) for future work outside the scope of the *current* task.
- Writing documentation or logs for the completed task *after* starting the next task.
- **Parallelising** work in any form.

---

## Only Then:

Once **all DoD (`05_Definition_of_Done.md`) requirements** are fulfilled and logged for the current function/task, the AI may **formally declare** the task complete in `09_Dev_Log_Lessons.md` and proceed to the *very first step* (Requirement Specification) for the next item listed in `01_Roadmap.md`.
