# Definition of Done - TDD-Enhanced AI Development Protocol

## Purpose

To ensure every AI-led implementation keep the code production-grade, documented, and traceable, supporting reliable continuation by anyone (AI or human). It formalises a zero-ambiguity workflow for sustainable product development, prioritizing automated verification.

---

## Applies To

All operations inside the following path:
`/Users/moldovan/Projects/`

---

## Required Steps (all must be fulfilled sequentially):

1.  **Specify Requirement:** Clearly define the user benefit or functionality needed for the feature, bug fix, or change (from `01_Roadmap.md`).
2.  **Implement Minimal Code:**
    * **AI Task:** Write minimum code to be able to deliver quick and quality.
3.  **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
    * **AI Task:** Improve code; Log everything and learn if commit, deploy or the application usage fails.
4.  **Manual Verification (If Applicable):**
    * Perform manual checks; log findings in `10_Development_Log.md`.
5.  **Update Documentation:**
    * Update `README.md` (if needed), and all additional documents
6.  **Version Control:**
    * Commit code and tests; apply Git tag; push commit and tags.
    * **Verification:** Log Git commands and push status (per `08_AI_Verification_Protocol.md`).
7.  **Deploy to Production:**
    * Deploy via `vercel --prod`.
    * **Verification:** Confirm success, log URL/failure (per `08_AI_Verification_Protocol.md`). Handle failures immediately.
8. **Production Verification:**
    * Check live URL; log outcome in `09_Dev_Log_Lessons.md`.
9. **Log Completion:**
    * Update `09_Dev_Log_Lessons.md` marking task complete with relevant links/hashes/verification details.

## Output Format (must include all):

-   Working application code.
-   Updated documentation files.
-   Successful production deployment URL.
-   Git commit hash and version tag.
-   Confirmation of steps logged.

---

## Quality Gates

- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, maintainable; follows conventions; error handling implemented.
- **Documentation:** Relevant files updated accurately; changes are clear and understandable.
- **Deployment:** Build passes without errors/warnings; no runtime errors post-deployment; environment variables correct.

## Violation Handling

If any requirement is not met or skipped: Halt the process; document the issue in `09_Lessons_Learned.md`; fix the problem; re-verify the failed step and subsequent steps; update documentation accordingly.
