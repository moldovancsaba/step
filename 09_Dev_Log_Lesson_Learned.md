Done Is Better - Lessons Learned

Git File Safety Incident - 2025-04-26

Incident Summary:
During the v1.15.1 release process, a broad git operation accidentally marked multiple project files for deletion including configuration, documentation, test, and asset files.

Root Cause:
Overly broad git commands without proper file targeting; Lack of pre-commit verification of changes.

Recovery Process:
Used git checkout HEAD~1 -- . to restore files; Verified files with git status; Carefully recommitted only intended changes.

Preventative Measures:
Always use specific file paths in git operations; Review git status before staging; Consider --patch mode for large changes; Create backups before major operations.

Key Lessons:
Prefer atomic commits; Consider automated file verification in CI pipeline; Document critical file locations.

2025-04-25: Build Stability & Git Tag Conflicts (v1.9.0 Completion)

Build Stability after Upgrade Attempt
Issue: Attempting Next.js upgrade (>14.0.4) caused persistent build errors (JSX, TypeScript types) despite fixes to tsconfig.json, ESLint config, component syntax. @hello-pangea/dnd also broke.
Solution: Reverted Next.js to 14.0.4; Aligned react versions in package.json; Cleaned node_modules/package-lock.json and reinstalled (npm install); Reinstalled @hello-pangea/dnd; Manually corrected residual errors.
Lesson: Major framework upgrades have complex interactions. If fixes fail, revert to stable version. Thoroughly vet dependencies and test post-upgrade. Document working versions in 02_Technology_Stack.md.

Git Tag Conflict Resolution
Issue: Pushing v1.9.0 tag failed due to existing local/remote tags pointing to old commit (7ac206d). New commit (611c1a5) needed the tag.
Solution: Deleted incorrect local tag (git tag -d v1.9.0); Deleted incorrect remote tag (git push origin --delete v1.9.0); Created correct local tag (git tag -a v1.9.0 -m "..." 611c1a5); Pushed correct tag (git push --tags).
Lesson: Ensure 05_Definition_of_Done.md is fully completed in one session (commits AND tags). Verify tag status (git tag, git ls-remote --tags origin) if interrupted. Have clear conflict resolution procedure.

Google Authentication Implementation (v1.7.0 - v1.7.1) - 2025-04-23

Challenge: TypeScript & Mongoose Type Inference
Issue: TypeScript struggled inferring _id type from Mongoose queries (e.g., UserModel.findOne) within NextAuth callbacks (jwt), causing build failures despite correct interfaces. Annotations were insufficient.
Solution: Implemented runtime check in jwt callback before dbUser._id.toString(): check if dbUser, dbUser._id, and dbUser._id.toString exist/are function.
Lesson: With complex library interactions (Mongoose, NextAuth, TypeScript), runtime checks can pragmatically unblock builds when type inference fails, though compile-time safety is reduced. Deeper investigation needed for root cause.

Challenge: Next.js Path Resolution (Aliases vs. Relative Paths)
Issue: Consistent Module not found errors importing into NextAuth API route (src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts) and server actions (src/lib/actions.ts). Both aliases (@/lib/... in tsconfig.json) and relative paths failed intermittently.
Solution: Moved shared logic (db connection, models) to top-level src/lib. Updated imports to use @/lib/... alias consistently.
Lesson: Next.js path resolution/aliases can be sensitive (e.g., in api/ routes). Centralizing shared logic in src/lib and using aliases consistently seems more robust for App Router. Avoid complex relative paths.

Challenge: Missing NEXTAUTH_SECRET in Production
Issue: Deployed auth resulted in "Server error". Vercel logs showed [next-auth][error][NO_SECRET].
Solution: Generated secret (openssl rand -base64 32), added NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable in Vercel Production settings, redeployed.
Lesson: NEXTAUTH_SECRET is mandatory for NextAuth production deployments. Production environment variables must be explicitly set in the deployment platform.

Challenge: User ID Management (Provider ID vs. Database ID)
Issue: Initial implementation stored Google ID (token.sub) in session (session.user.id). Server actions used this Google ID when querying Card collection's user field (expecting MongoDB ObjectId), causing CastError.
Solution: Modified NextAuth callbacks: signIn ensures MongoDB _id is available; jwt fetches User doc using Google ID (token.sub) and stores MongoDB _id as token.dbUserId; session assigns token.dbUserId to session.user.id. Server actions now use MongoDB _id.
Lesson: Distinguish external provider ID from internal database _id. Ensure session contains the internal ID needed for database operations.

Challenge: Build vs. Development Discrepancies
Issue: Several issues (TypeScript types, path resolution) only appeared during production build (npm run build), not dev server (npm run dev).
Solution: Adopted workflow: run npm run build locally after significant changes before commit/deploy.
Lesson: npm run dev compilation differs from npm run build. Always test with npm run build early.

Feature Dependencies and Clean Removal (2025-04-20 - Auth0 Attempt)

Challenge: Removing prior Auth0 integration required understanding dependencies across codebase (context provider, protected routes, layout, middleware, config, components, next.config.js redirect).
Key Lessons: Document ALL feature touchpoints (dependency mapping). Consider a Feature Registry. Design features with clean boundaries (isolation, abstraction). Create removal checklists.

Authentication Implementation Challenges (2025-04-18 - Auth0 Attempt)

Key Lessons: Check library compatibility with Next.js versions. Middleware can have Edge runtime conflicts. Have rollback procedures (git reset --hard, cleanup node_modules, .next). Consider Auth.js (NextAuth v5+) for better Next.js support. Test in isolation.

2025-04-18: Git File Casing Inconsistency
Issue: Had two files due to different casing (x.md vs x.MD) tracked by Git.
Solution: Standardized casing, used git mv if needed, ensured Git tracked only one.
Lesson: Maintain consistent filename casing. Be careful on case-insensitive systems.

2025-04-13: Drag-and-Drop Debugging & Library Switch (@dnd-kit to @hello-pangea/dnd) (v0.8.0)

Challenge: @dnd-kit built successfully but failed functionally (hydration/runtime errors).
Solution: Switched to @hello-pangea/dnd (React 18 compatible react-beautiful-dnd fork).
Lesson: Successful builds don't guarantee runtime success. If debugging is complex, consider alternative libraries suited for the task (@hello-pangea/dnd was simpler for this list reordering). Test functionality locally after builds.
Implementation with @hello-pangea/dnd: Required refactoring components (DragDropContext, Droppable, Draggable) and onDragEnd logic to match new API/structure. Ensured client-only rendering.

2025-04-13: Persistent Reordering (bulkWrite) (v0.7.0)

Persisting Order with bulkWrite: Implemented updateCardsOrder server action using Mongoose bulkWrite with updateOne operations for efficient batch updates. Client maps reordered list state to call this action.
Lesson: bulkWrite is highly performant for batch updates like saving list order.
Default Ordering Strategy: Assigned order: -Date.now() in createCard action to place new cards first when sorting order ascending.
Lesson: Negative timestamps offer simple default reverse-chronological order.

Historical Lessons (v0.1.0 - v0.6.0 Summary)

v0.6.0: Handled visual intra-column reordering client-side.
v0.5.0: Initial @dnd-kit attempt, optimistic UI state management.
v0.4.0: Implemented Kanban layout (KanbanBoard, Column), managed client state derived from server data.
v0.3.0: Implemented swipe actions (react-swipeable), client components (CardList, CardItem), optimistic UI updates.
v0.2.0: Implemented core functionality (Input, createCard action, lib/db.js), handled server action responses, ensured data serialization (lean(), _id.toString()).
v0.1.0: Initial Next.js setup, deployment attempts, basic MongoDB connection pooling, simplified CSS.

2025-04-17: Vercel Deployment Issues

Persistent 401 Auth Errors: Resolved by removing local .vercel directory and relinking project (vercel link) when CLI behavior contradicted dashboard settings.
Persistent Extraneous Package Investigation: Ignored persistent extraneous package (@emnapi/runtime@1.4.3) after standard removal attempts failed, as npm audit showed 0 vulnerabilities and builds succeeded (aligns with 'Done is Better' principle, potentially relates to original Rule 07).

2025-04-24: Security Vulnerability Neutralized

Issue: Critical NPM dependency vulnerability detected.
Action: Executed npm audit fix --force.
Verification: Post-fix audit showed 0 vulnerabilities.
