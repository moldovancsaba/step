## Task: Documentation Update - Initial Project Documentation Setup

**Date Started:** 2025-05-13T15:58:30+02:00
**Date Completed:** 2025-05-13T16:30:00+02:00

### Summary of Work Done:

* Completed comprehensive documentation setup for STEP project
* Updated core documentation files with project structure, requirements, and technical details
* Files modified:
  - `02_Technology_Stack.md`: Added complete technology stack details
  - `04_TDD_Protocol.md`: Added sphere mapping test examples and conventions
  - `01_roadmap.md`: Defined MVP features and environment setup tasks
  - `README.md`: Enhanced with technical architecture and setup instructions

### Definition of Done Checklist & Verification (Ref: `05_Definition_of_Done.md`):

1.  **Requirement Specified:** Initial project documentation setup
2.  **Documentation Updated:**
    * `✅ DOCS UPDATED:`
    * `02_Technology_Stack.md` - Added complete technology stack
    * `04_TDD_Protocol.md` - Added test examples for 2D mapping
    * `01_roadmap.md` - Defined MVP features (TSK-001, TSK-002)
    * `README.md` - Added architecture and setup details
3.  **Version Control:**
    * `# EXECUTED: git init`
    * `# EXECUTED: git add 01_roadmap.md 02_Technology_Stack.md 04_TDD_Protocol.md README.md`
    * `# EXECUTED: git commit -m "docs: comprehensive documentation update for STEP project"`
    * Commit Hash: 6901cfe
    * `# EXECUTED: git tag -a v0.2.0-docs -m "Documentation update for STEP project"`
    * `# VERIFIED: Initial repository setup complete`
4.  **Version Control & Deployment:**
    * `# EXECUTED: git remote set-url origin https://{TOKEN}@github.com/moldovancsaba/step.git`
    * `# EXECUTED: git push -u origin main --tags`
    * `# VERIFIED: Successfully pushed to GitHub repository`
    * `# EXECUTED: vercel --prod`
    * `# VERIFIED: Deployment successful`
    * Production URL: https://step-34d0arp08-narimato.vercel.app
    * Deployment Time: 2025-05-13T22:54:10+02:00

### Key Decisions:

1. **Technology Stack:**
   * Selected Next.js v15.2.4 with App Router for modern SSR capabilities
   * Chose Zustand for state management due to its simplicity and efficiency
   * Implemented strict TypeScript mode for enhanced type safety

2. **Testing Strategy:**
   * Defined test naming convention for triangle mesh mapping system
   * Established geometric test patterns for triangle division validation
   * Set up component testing structure with React Testing Library

3. **MVP Features:**
   * Prioritized core triangle mesh mapping functionality
   * Defined strict acceptance criteria for geometric accuracy
   * Established MongoDB integration requirements

### Next Steps:

1. Initialize project with defined technology stack
2. Set up testing environment according to TDD Protocol
3. Begin implementation of TSK-001 (Core triangle mesh Mapping)

### Notes:

* Documentation structure now supports AI-assisted development workflow
* All core documents are in place for starting development
* Version control initialized with appropriate tagging strategy
