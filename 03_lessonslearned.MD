# Lessons Learned

## Git Repository Management (2024-01-09)

### Issue: Large Files in Git History
- Problem: node_modules and build artifacts were accidentally committed, causing repository bloat
- Impact: Push failures due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit
- Files affected: Primarily @next/swc-darwin-arm64/next-swc.darwin-arm64.node (~104.9MB)

### Solution
1. Implemented proper .gitignore from project start
2. Used git-filter-repo to clean history
3. Established fresh repository with clean history
4. Added comprehensive .gitignore for Next.js project

### Best Practices Established
1. Never commit node_modules or build artifacts
2. Always verify .gitignore before initial commit
3. Use git status and git check-ignore to verify ignored files
4. Regular repository size monitoring
5. Keep commits focused on source code only

### Prevention Strategy
- Implement pre-commit hooks if needed
- Regular repository health checks
- Document build and dependency management procedures
- Clear separation of source code and build artifacts
